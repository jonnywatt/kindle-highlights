A patent effectively grants the inventor a limited monopoly on the manufacture, use, or sale of the invention. However, a patent actually only grants to the patentee the right to exclude (i.e., to prevent others from practicing the patented invention); it does not actually grant to the patentee the right to use the patented invention.

As Hoppe notes: [O]nly because scarcity exists is there even a problem of formulating moral laws; insofar as goods are superabundant (“free” goods), no conflict over the use of goods is possible and no action-coordination is needed. Hence, it follows that any ethic, correctly conceived, must be formulated as a theory of property, i.e., a theory of the assignment of rights of exclusive control over scarce means. Because only then does it become possible to avoid otherwise inescapable and unresolvable conflict.56

As Arnold Plant explains: It is a peculiarity of property rights in patents (and copyrights) that they do not arise out of the scarcity of the objects which become appropriated. They are not a consequence of scarcity. They are the deliberate creation of statute law, and, whereas in general the institution of private property makes for the preservation of scarce goods, tending ... to lead us “to make the most of them,” property rights in patents and copyrights make possible the creation of a scarcity of the products appropriated which could not otherwise be maintained.

Creation, therefore, is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish ownership. The focus on creation distracts from the crucial role of first occupation as a property rule for addressing the fundamental fact of scarcity. First occupation, not creation or labor, is both necessary and sufficient for the homesteading of unowned scarce resources.

In other words, the third party acquires a tangible thing—a book or a mousetrap, say—but it is somehow “missing” the “right-to-copy” part of the bundle of rights that “normally” constitutes all rights to the thing. Or, the third party acquires “ownership” of information, from a person who did not own the information and, thus, was not entitled to transmit it to others.85 But surely something is amiss here.

Suppose that A writes a novel and sells a first copy, BOOK1, without restriction (i.e., without a reservation of rights) to B1; and a second copy, BOOK2, to B2 —but “reserving” the book’s inherent “right to copy.” The two books, BOOK1 and BOOK2, appear to third parties to be otherwise identical. Yet they are not: one is incomplete; the other somehow contains more mystical “rights-essence” within its covers. Suppose B1 and B2 leave these books on a park bench, where they are discovered by third party T. According to Rothbard, BOOK2 is “missing” the “right to copy,” much like an electronic toy that is sold “batteries not included.” It is as if there is an invisible, mystical tendril of “reproduction-ownership” stretching from BOOK2 back to its true owner A, wherever he may be. Thus, even if T finds and homesteads the abandoned BOOK2, this book simply does not contain “within itself” the right to permit the owner to copy it. It is being continually siphoned away by a rights wormhole which connects the item to owner A. Thus, if T homesteads the book, he still homesteads no more than he acquires. T homesteads only a book without a right to copy “built in,” and, thus, does not have the right to copy BOOK2. The same is true for subsequent third parties who come to possess the book.

socialism, by no means an invention of nineteenth century Marxism but much older, must be conceptualized as an institutionalized interference with or aggression against private property and private property claims. Capitalism, on the other hand, is a social system based on the explicit recognition of private property and of nonaggressive, contractual exchanges between private property owners.

If this system is altered and instead a policy is instituted that assigns rights of exclusive control over scarce means, however partial, to persons or groups of persons that can point neither to an act of previous usership of the things concerned, nor to a contractual relation with some previous user-owner, then this will be called (partial) socialism.

capitalism as based on private ownership of means of production simply appears chaotic. It seems to be a wasteful system characterized by duplicating efforts, ruinous competition, and the absence of concerted, coordinated action. As Marxists call it depreciatively, it is an “anarchy of production.”

Just as much as capitalism then, socialism has to find a solution to the problem of determining how to coordinate the uses of different means of production, given the fact of differing views among people on how this should be accomplished. The difference between capitalism and socialism is again one of how coordination is achieved, and not between chaos and coordination, as the socialist semantic insinuates.

capitalism coordinates actions by constraining people to respect previous user-ownership. Socialism, on the other hand, instead of letting people do whatever pleases them, coordinates individual plans by superimposing on one person’s or group of persons’ plan that of another disagreeing person or group regardless of prior ownership and mutual exchange agreements.

Because of how the ADHD brain operates, we have a hard time paying attention if something isn’t inherently interesting or emotionally engaging. Functions that we find monotonous or mundane create more difficulties for us. That is why we will so often get distracted by lower-priority tasks—they are more interesting or more easily accomplished than our higher-priority tasks.

Most people who have ADHD have a divergent thinking pattern that makes falling down rabbit holes a way of life. Divergent, in this case, means tending to develop in different directions, usually at once. Though the technical name is divergent thinking, some people might refer to it as out-of-the-box, nonlinear, or creative thinking. Those with ADHD naturally gravitate toward this type of thinking; their minds generate ideas far beyond rote thinking or expected boundaries.

Making a decision feels very challenging when we try to rely only on divergent thinking. Many of my clients complain, “There are so many options. How do I know the best one?” When they use divergent thinking, all ideas are treated equally regardless of context or applicability. Projected goals, rules, directions, or criteria are often neglected as divergent thinkers tackle a problem from multiple perspectives to find original solutions.

Procrastination begins with avoidance thoughts such as, I don’t feel like doing that right now. We imagine a magical time when we will feel intrinsically motivated to do that task. And we wait. And we wait until we can wait no longer. Then with the quickly approaching deadline, a wicked wave of anxiety, fear, or anger pushes us into action. We complete the task with only minutes to spare. This is our genius tactic for getting things done that combines the two previous techniques: avoidance and anxiety.

In using shame to motivate ourselves, we tend to rehearse the ways that we are incomplete, damaged, incompetent, weak, and stupid. Taking those broken beliefs, we challenge ourselves to prove that we are not those things. It is a sucker’s game. Though a task may be completed eventually, we experience no win because we still feel exhausted and emptied by the shame we carry.

Though researchers think that several parts of the brain may be associated with the symptoms of ADHD, one area is particularly interesting when we are talking about the idea of fun. Right in the center of the brain is a part called the striatum. Known as the pleasure center of the brain, the striatum helps evaluate whether something is good and then allows us to experience joy and happiness. It is also able to learn to predict when rewards are coming.

An interesting thing happened, however, when researchers viewed the scans of the students who had ADHD. Their striata didn’t light up as much when they saw the diamond shape, even though it preceded the coin image indicating a reward would be coming soon. The striata in these brains didn’t become active until the students actually saw the jar with coins. The striata of those with ADHD responded most when they actually received the reward, not while they were waiting for the reward.

Break the ugly Yellow task into small, how-to steps. I often hear my clients say when talking about Yellow tasks, “I don’t even know where to start.” This is because very often, the job that they are procrastinating on feels too big or too vague. Take the time to write the steps out, no matter how small they seem. This simple practice will help you see how to complete the task.

Make an agreement with yourself that you will work on the Yellow item for twenty minutes. If after that time you haven’t gotten into the flow of it, then move to a different task.

Evening Practice. How well did you stay out of the Red Quadrant today? Were you able to think more clearly when you weren’t in that quadrant? What key behaviors worked for you through Yellow Quadrant tasks? Were you more aware of the times when you were slipping into Blue Quadrant activities? What did you do to refocus your efforts?

The Red, Blue, and Back Again Pattern In this energy pattern, we move from the Red Quadrant to the Blue and then back to Red. Tasks in the Red Quadrant seem to hold us in a frantic, frenzied state. We tell ourselves that we are the most productive there, and we work there for as long as we can. And then we flop to Blue because we are tired, depleted, and sometimes even sad. Then we muster our anxiety, anger, or whatever strong emotion we need to spur us back to Red.

Do you find at times that you know you should be doing something productive but are too fatigued mentally or physically to do anything at all, only to press yourself into hyper-action a day or two later?

Although he was smart, he was convinced that neither college nor training school would be a good fit for him. He spent his days hanging out with his band, playing first-person-shooter video games, planning campaigns for Dungeons and Dragons, and working part-time delivering pizzas. “I’m not sure that I know what I want to do,” he explained, “so I don’t do anything.” His smile was sweetly disarming as he talked. He carefully avoided tasks that weren’t fun and might involve any negative emotions.

They steer clear of getting tangled up in any anxiety that Yellow or Red Quadrant activities may cause and find distractions and shelter in Blue.

they occupy themselves with entertainment or some sort of busywork. Life often feels too complicated and too meticulous for them, and Blue is a cozy place to stay for a while.

Hidden deep within this pattern is the false belief that if you perform flawlessly, you will gain people’s acceptance and love. The fear of letting someone down by failing at a task is so great that you choose not to do anything.

Another false belief is that if you can’t do it perfectly, you won’t even take the risk. Examine how you have endorsed perfectionism in your life, and expose it for the lie that it is—no one does anything perfectly.

Morning Practice. Face the Blue. What Blue Quadrant distractions may get in your way today? What activity drags you into the Nothin’-but-Blue pattern? Are you addicted to it? Can you easily stop the activity? For example, if it is a game on your phone or computer, try going twenty-four hours without engaging in it.

Try the Yellow-Blue game: work for thirty minutes, then take a ten-minute Blue break. The critical detail here is to set a timer. Many of my clients have used this with a lot of success. TJ told me, “I accidentally continued in a Yellow task because I really got into it.”

Evening Practice. When your three Yellow Quadrant tasks are completed, treat yourself to a longer, relaxing Blue Quadrant activity. Or, better yet, do a Green Quadrant activity that will nourish your energy level.
